to implement the different pages eg inbox today upcoming
can use the same as the previous project restaurant page (modules to load ya)

stuff to implement :

edit button functionality - edit priority, date, title, details DONE

details modal to be more sexy 

different project tabs



project tabbing

click the plus (eventlistener)

open up aform to get project name

append to dom 

event listner to the project

when click on that it shuld load its project page 
    how to do that:
    clear the page
    load the title + add task button (omg.)
    then function as usual (how to add task to each project page? WTF.)each project have its own array?
    
initAddProjectButtons > Addproject popup + add project logic > add project to dom > initprojectbuttons > handleprojectbuttons> open project > load project > load tasks >display+  inittaskbuttons> submit task, 

DELETE TASK EDIT TASK CHECK OFF TASK
